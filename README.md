# Multiplayer-Game-with-Chat-Support
I have built a multiplayer game with chat support. The game is tic-tac-toe and added the feature of chatting so that users can chat and interact with each other while playing the game. It also adjusts its theme based on events in a calendar year.\
I built this project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I used NodeJS and Socket.io for message sending, receiving and for the display of turns to the other player. I have used two JavaScript files, one of them acting as server to return responses. I have added CSS to the chat boxes and game grid. I have set the theme of the whole game on the basis of festivals months which helps the user give personalized experience and friendly environment.\
I have set the whole project theme for different festivals and occasions according to the month in which they appear. I have used images of specific festival materials resembling "O" and "X". I have also given a feature of sending emojis too which help the users to express their feelings or expressions which they can't explain in words. I have added the feature of Reset button for resetting the game so that the users would not have to reload the website to play again. The logic automatically alternates between players giving them a fair chance to play.\
